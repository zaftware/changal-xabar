    "body": "On February 25, 2026, Anthropic announced that it acquired Vercept. Anthropic said the goal is to improve Claude's computer use capabilities so the model can handle more complex tasks inside live applications, such as writing and running code across repositories, synthesizing research from many sources, and managing workflows across tools. Anthropic framed computer use as a way for Claude to act inside the same software humans use, not just answer in chat. The Vercept team includes researchers focused on perception and interaction problems that matter when AI systems need to see and act inside software."
